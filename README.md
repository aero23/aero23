- I am an aerospace engineer working for a company that makes small engines for UAVs.
- I’m interested in Android and Arduino.
- I’m currently learning Kotlin for Android, uController programming, C++, Matlab, Python, Linux OS.

  ANDROID - I have an extremely useful app idea I want to put together, something I have not found available yet. I actually got this idea back in 2009 when I got my first smart phone, but gave up trying to learn Java for Android. I decided to try again...
  uCONTROLLER - I have a rain water collection/filtration system I built at home using an ABB programmable relay (bacially a small PLC with built in relay outputs). My plan is to learn on Arduino how to replace the PLC with a custom board, or just use an Arduino so I can add functionality.
  C++ / MATLAB - I have already written a propeller design code in Matlab and want to try going directly into a custom mesher (so I can have more control over boundary layer and wake meshing) and then use OpenFOAM to run CFD simulations and optimize the design. Most of this might be able to actually run right in Matlab. <very ambitious>
  PYTHON - just curious, and being that it is similar to other related languages I am learning, I assume it shouldn't be difficult to get a grasp of. I have no immediate need for it, except be able to know what others are talking about.
  LINUX OS - OpenFOAM was written for Linux and I just want to get more familiar with it. I have a laptop that dual boots into either Windows or Ubuntu.
